Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster. more and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations and hands-on worksheets, it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lef, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lef was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lef an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Leve also had a habit of sending me five to ten news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart and they all came in a span of under half an hour. Now eventually I started to wonder what was up and so I went into Leve's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles. And when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that in fact his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you, my mistake. He told me that no actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity When you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on on speed reading and mnemonics or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself and I'd never actually succeeded. I tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I tried that Evelyn Woodbook 7-day speed reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill and fortunately for me, and offered private coaching sessions. Now, they weren't cheap and the whole process took about 6 weeks. But, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself during group exams or group work, reading the pages, and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10 to 15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, Exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction, and in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on UDEMI and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses and marketplaces, pedagogical design and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We'd even ranked among the top instructors in the history of UDEMI. And that brings us to where we are today, Super Learner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing. And we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at home training. It's not going to be easy. a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information, first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.", 'segments': [{'text': " Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, become", 'start': 0.0, 'end': 9.72}, {'text': ' a super learner.', 'start': 9.72, 'end': 11.52}, {'text': " Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed", 'start': 11.52, 'end': 15.280000000000001}, {'text': ' to super learning.', 'start': 15.280000000000001, 'end': 17.080000000000002}, {'text': " Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.", 'start': 17.080000000000002, 'end': 22.48}, {'text': " Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster.", 'start': 22.48, 'end': 26.400000000000002}, {'text': ' more and unlock the vast potential of your mind.', 'start': 26.4, 'end': 30.08}, {'text': " Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.", 'start': 30.08, 'end': 35.519999999999996}, {'text': " It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking", 'start': 35.519999999999996, 'end': 41.56}, {'text': ' for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.', 'start': 41.56, 'end': 45.76}, {'text': " It's also jam packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations and hands-on worksheets,", 'start': 45.76, 'end': 52.599999999999994}, {'text': " it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster. more and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations and hands-on worksheets, it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lef, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lef was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lef an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Leve also had a habit of sending me five to ten news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart and they all came in a span of under half an hour. Now eventually I started to wonder what was up and so I went into Leve's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles. And when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that in fact his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you, my mistake. He told me that no actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity When you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on on speed reading and mnemonics or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself and I'd never actually succeeded. I tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I tried that Evelyn Woodbook 7-day speed reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill and fortunately for me, and offered private coaching sessions. Now, they weren't cheap and the whole process took about 6 weeks. But, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself during group exams or group work, reading the pages, and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10 to 15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, Exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction, and in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on UDEMI and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses and marketplaces, pedagogical design and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We'd even ranked among the top instructors in the history of UDEMI. And that brings us to where we are today, Super Learner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing. And we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at home training. It's not going to be easy. a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information, first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.","segments":[{"text":" Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, become","start":0.0,"end":9.72},{"text":" a super learner.","start":9.72,"end":11.52},{"text":" Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed","start":11.52,"end":15.280000000000001},{"text":" to super learning.","start":15.280000000000001,"end":17.080000000000002},{"text":" Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.","start":17.080000000000002,"end":22.48},{"text":" Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster.","start":22.48,"end":26.400000000000002},{"text":" more and unlock the vast potential of your mind.","start":26.4,"end":30.08},{"text":" Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.","start":30.08,"end":35.519999999999996},{"text":" It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking","start":35.519999999999996,"end":41.56},{"text":" for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.","start":41.56,"end":45.76},{"text":" It's also jam packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations and hands-on worksheets,","start":45.76,"end":52.599999999999994},{"text":" it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster. more and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations and hands-on worksheets, it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lef, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lef was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lef an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Leve also had a habit of sending me five to ten news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart and they all came in a span of under half an hour. Now eventually I started to wonder what was up and so I went into Leve's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles. And when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that in fact his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you, my mistake. He told me that no actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity When you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on on speed reading and mnemonics or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself and I'd never actually succeeded. I tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I tried that Evelyn Woodbook 7-day speed reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill and fortunately for me, and offered private coaching sessions. Now, they weren't cheap and the whole process took about 6 weeks. But, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself during group exams or group work, reading the pages, and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10 to 15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, Exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction, and in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on UDEMI and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses and marketplaces, pedagogical design and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We'd even ranked among the top instructors in the history of UDEMI. And that brings us to where we are today, Super Learner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing. And we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at home training. It's not going to be easy. a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information, first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage.

Use `--language` to specify the language\nDetected language: English\n[00:00.000 --> 00:09.560]  We know you're excited to begin the course, so we won't make this a long lecture.\n[00:09.560 --> 00:13.960]  We just want to make sure that you know about the most powerful resource and companion you'll\n[00:13.960 --> 00:19.360]  have in your journey to becoming a super learner, the PDF syllabus.\n[00:19.360 --> 00:24.560]  In this all-in-one document, you'll find a week-by-week guide explaining your weekly\n[00:24.560 --> 00:30.800]  goals and expected milestones, as well as convenient and easy to use links to each and\n[00:30.800 --> 00:36.940]  every one of the resources, games, worksheets, and supplemental materials.\n[00:36.940 --> 00:37.940]  What?\n[00:37.940 --> 00:40.620]  You didn't think there would be homework?\n[00:40.620 --> 00:42.280]  Of course there is.\n[00:42.280 --> 00:46.320]  After all, learning is not a spectator sport.\n[00:46.320 --> 00:51.200]  One of the many things you're going to soon understand about learning is that it absolutely\n[00:51.200 --> 00:52.200]  must be hands-on.\n[00:52.200 --> 00:58.120]  hands-on. If it's not in your hands, it's not in your head. This means that sitting\n[00:58.120 --> 01:04.120]  here and listening to my explanations is really only 20% of the course. The rest of the time,\n[01:04.480 --> 01:10.320]  you'll be doing worksheets, practicing reading and memory skills, playing fun games, watching\n[01:10.320 --> 01:15.540]  inspiring videos from famous superlearners, and chatting with your peers in the lively\n[01:15.540 --> 01:22.000]  superlearner Facebook community. Don't worry, it's going to be a lot of fun. In addition,\n[01:22.200 --> 01:27.700]  the PDF syllabus, you can optionally download a nice HTML bookmarks file, which you can\n[01:27.700 --> 01:39.700]  easily import into any browser, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and even Internet Explorer\n[01:39.700 --> 01:41.380]  or Microsoft Edge.\n[01:41.380 --> 01:44.560]  Please take a moment to download all of these resources now.\n[01:52.200 --> 01:56.640]  Since you'll be referring to these links and games nearly every single day for\n[01:56.640 --> 02:00.440]  the next couple of months, we suggest saving them somewhere where they're easy\n[02:00.440 --> 02:07.880]  to find. So please pause the video now and download them. I'll wait right here.\n[02:10.080 --> 02:15.560]  Great, you're back. You'll notice that we ask you to set aside five to six\n[02:15.560 --> 02:21.120]  sessions of about 40 minutes in length every week.

Use `--language` to specify the language\nDetected language: English\n[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become\n[00:09.720 --> 00:11.200]  a Super Learner.\n[00:11.200 --> 00:15.360]  Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to\n[00:15.360 --> 00:16.680]  super learning.\n[00:16.680 --> 00:22.480]  Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.\n[00:22.480 --> 00:27.940]  Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the\n[00:27.940 --> 00:29.860]  vast potential of your mind.\n[00:29.860 --> 00:35.500]  Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.\n[00:35.500 --> 00:41.540]  It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking\n[00:41.540 --> 00:46.220]  for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.\n[00:46.220 --> 00:52.680]  It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making\n[00:52.680 --> 00:56.740]  it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.\n[00:56.740 --> 01:02.200]  Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking\n[01:02.200 --> 01:05.260]  your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.\n[01:05.260 --> 01:09.400]  Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.\n[01:09.400 --> 01:14.500]  But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course\n[01:14.500 --> 01:20.960]  originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.\n[01:20.960 --> 01:26.520]  So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture\n[01:26.520 --> 01:31.980]  capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who\n[01:31.980 --> 01:36.060]  was working in one of the startups there in the VC.\n[01:36.060 --> 01:41.980]  I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.\n[01:41.980 --> 01:47.520]  When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or\n[01:47.520 --> 01:51.720]  two with half a page of comments.\n[01:51.720 --> 01:57.140]  Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there\n[01:57.140 --> 01:59.360]  and drank his coffee.\n[01:59.360 --> 02:04.820]  These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half\n[02:04.820 --> 02:06.760]  an hour.\n[02:06.760 --> 02:12.160]  Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and\n[02:12.160 --> 02:15.320]  I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.\n[02:15.320 --> 02:20.180]  So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully\n[02:20.180 --> 02:26.800]  send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when\n[02:26.800 --> 02:32.780]  I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension\n[02:32.780 --> 02:38.940]  of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it\n[02:38.940 --> 02:44.700]  before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he\n[02:44.700 --> 02:51.060]  was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was\n[02:51.060 --> 02:57.420]  sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity\n[02:57.420 --> 03:02.020]  when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for\n[03:02.020 --> 03:08.260]  something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists\n[03:08.260 --> 03:14.440]  here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques.\n[03:14.440 --> 03:20.680]  Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded.\n[03:20.680 --> 03:28.080]  I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading.\n[03:28.080 --> 03:34.300]  When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about\n[03:34.300 --> 03:36.700]  20% comprehension.\n[03:36.700 --> 03:46.840]  Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension.\n[03:46.840 --> 03:52.520]  Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and\n[03:52.520 --> 03:57.300]  fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions.\n[03:57.300 --> 04:02.680]  They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say\n[04:02.680 --> 04:10.360]  this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year\n[04:10.360 --> 04:16.640]  MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman\n[04:16.640 --> 04:23.080]  workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work,\n[04:23.080 --> 04:28.640]  reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15\n[04:28.640 --> 04:32.600]  minutes to read the exact same content.\n[04:32.600 --> 04:36.760]  There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd\n[04:36.760 --> 04:39.840]  really appreciate if you would actually read the article.\n[04:39.840 --> 04:43.020]  And I'd say, yeah, I read the article.\n[04:43.020 --> 04:49.140]  In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for.\n[04:49.140 --> 04:54.560]  Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions.\n[04:54.560 --> 04:58.120]  The biggest one is, can anyone do this?\n[04:58.120 --> 05:00.300]  And the answer is yes.\n[05:00.300 --> 05:04.720]  You can do this, but only with the proper instruction.\n[05:04.720 --> 05:09.820]  And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev.\n[05:09.820 --> 05:15.420]  Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private\n[05:15.420 --> 05:17.960]  coaching lessons via Skype.\n[05:17.960 --> 05:23.280]  But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise\n[05:23.280 --> 05:27.680]  her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach\n[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  everyone.\n[05:28.680 --> 05:34.560]  Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be\n[05:34.560 --> 05:40.460]  a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills.\n[05:40.460 --> 05:45.100]  So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research\n[05:45.100 --> 05:49.460]  that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it.\n[05:49.460 --> 05:54.680]  I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses,\n[05:54.680 --> 05:58.860]  and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more.\n[05:58.860 --> 06:03.780]  Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen\n[06:03.780 --> 06:04.780]  next.\n[06:04.780 --> 06:10.100]  Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students.\n[06:10.100 --> 06:13.080]  We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts.\n[06:13.080 --> 06:15.680]  We'd published a best-selling book.\n[06:15.680 --> 06:20.980]  We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.\n[06:20.980 --> 06:25.400]  And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0.\n[06:25.400 --> 06:29.440]  Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot.\n[06:29.440 --> 06:33.680]  We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where\n[06:33.680 --> 06:35.320]  students struggle.\n[06:35.320 --> 06:38.620]  We know which topics need a little more clarification.\n[06:38.620 --> 06:44.500]  We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations.\n[06:44.500 --> 06:49.920]  All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world\n[06:49.920 --> 06:55.140]  testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading\n[06:55.140 --> 06:58.380]  program on the face of the planet.\n[06:58.380 --> 07:03.260]  Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process,\n[07:03.260 --> 07:05.540]  starting with hacking your memory.\n[07:05.540 --> 07:10.320]  We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading\n[07:10.320 --> 07:15.980]  speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training.\n[07:15.980 --> 07:18.240]  It's not going to be easy.\n[07:18.240 --> 07:22.800]  Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading\n[07:22.800 --> 07:24.560]  programs out there.\n[07:24.560 --> 07:27.900]  It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn.\n[07:27.900 --> 07:33.040]  This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information\n[07:33.040 --> 07:35.020]  first and foremost.\n[07:35.020 --> 07:39.540]  What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going\n[07:39.540 --> 07:41.460]  to happen overnight.\n[07:41.460 --> 07:46.880]  But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you\n[07:46.880 --> 07:48.780]  will succeed.\n[07:48.780 --> 07:52.980]  If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all\n[07:52.980 --> 07:57.940]  of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn.\n[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping\n[08:02.460 --> 08:05.340]  to do the homework of that week at each stage.\n[08:05.340 --> 08:10.880]  And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.\n","task_id":"bd898661-901d-4648-b90e-70d7adc11b8c"}]

You'll find the exact information we're looking for.\n[04:49.140 --> 04:54.560]  Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions.\n[04:54.560 --> 04:58.120]  The biggest one is, can anyone do this?\n[04:58.120 --> 05:00.300]  And the answer is yes.\n[05:00.300 --> 05:04.720]  You can do this, but only with the proper instruction.\n[05:04.720 --> 05:09.820]  And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev.\n[05:09.820 --> 05:15.420]  Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private\n[05:15.420 --> 05:17.960]  coaching lessons via Skype.\n[05:17.960 --> 05:23.280]  But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise\n[05:23.280 --> 05:27.680]  her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach\n[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  everyone.\n[05:28.680 --> 05:34.560]  Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be\n[05:34.560 --> 05:40.460]  a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills.\n[05:40.460 --> 05:45.100]  So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research\n[05:45.100 --> 05:49.460]  that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it.\n[05:49.460 --> 05:54.680]  I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses,\n[05:54.680 --> 05:58.860]  and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more.\n[05:58.860 --> 06:03.780]  Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen\n[06:03.780 --> 06:04.780]  next.\n[06:04.780 --> 06:10.100]  Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students.\n[06:10.100 --> 06:13.080]  We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts.\n[06:13.080 --> 06:15.680]  We'd published a best-selling book.\n[06:15.680 --> 06:20.980]  We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.\n[06:20.980 --> 06:25.400]  And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0.\n[06:25.400 --> 06:29.440]  Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot.\n[06:29.440 --> 06:33.680]  We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where\n[06:33.680 --> 06:35.320]  students struggle.\n[06:35.320 --> 06:38.620]  We know which topics need a little more clarification.\n[06:38.620 --> 06:44.500]  We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations.\n[06:44.500 --> 06:49.920]  All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world\n[06:49.920 --> 06:55.140]  testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading\n[06:55.140 --> 06:58.380]  program on the face of the planet.\n[06:58.380 --> 07:03.260]  Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process,\n[07:03.260 --> 07:05.540]  starting with hacking your memory.\n[07:05.540 --> 07:10.320]  We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading\n[07:10.320 --> 07:15.980]  speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training.\n[07:15.980 --> 07:18.240]  It's not going to be easy.\n[07:18.240 --> 07:22.800]  Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading\n[07:22.800 --> 07:24.560]  programs out there.\n[07:24.560 --> 07:27.900]  It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn.\n[07:27.900 --> 07:33.040]  This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information\n[07:33.040 --> 07:35.020]  first and foremost.\n[07:35.020 --> 07:39.540]  What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going\n[07:39.540 --> 07:41.460]  to happen overnight.\n[07:41.460 --> 07:46.880]  But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you\n[07:46.880 --> 07:48.780]  will succeed.\n[07:48.780 --> 07:52.980]  If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all\n[07:52.980 --> 07:57.940]  of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn.\n[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping\n[08:02.460 --> 08:05.340]  to do the homework of that week at each stage.\n[08:05.340 --> 08:10.880]  And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.\n","task_id":"bd898661-901d-4648-b90e-70d7adc11b8c"}]

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory, and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses, and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy. And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It's not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.","segments":[{"text":" Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become","start":0.0,"end":9.72},{"text":" a Super Learner.","start":9.72,"end":11.200000000000001},{"text":" Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to","start":11.200000000000001,"end":15.36},{"text":" super learning.","start":15.36,"end":16.68},{"text":" Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.","start":16.68,"end":22.48},{"text":" Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the","start":22.48,"end":27.94},{"text":" vast potential of your mind.","start":27.94,"end":29.86},{"text":" Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.","start":29.86,"end":35.5},{"text":" It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking","start":35.5,"end":41.54},{"text":" for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.","start":41.54,"end":46.22},{"text":" It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making","start":46.22,"end":52.68000000000001},{"text":" it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.","start":52.68000000000001,"end":56.74},{"text":" Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking","start":56.74,"end":62.2},{"text":" your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.","start":62.2,"end":65.26},{"text":" Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.","start":65.26,"end":69.4},{"text":" But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course","start":69.4,"end":74.5},{"text":" originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.","start":74.5,"end":80.96000000000001},{"text":" So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture","start":80.96000000000001,"end":86.52000000000001},{"text":" capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who","start":86.52,"end":91.97999999999999},{"text":" was working in one of the startups there in the VC.","start":91.97999999999999,"end":96.06},{"text":" I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.","start":96.06,"end":101.97999999999999},{"text":" When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or","start":101.97999999999999,"end":107.52},{"text":" two with half a page of comments.","start":107.52,"end":111.72},{"text":" Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there","start":111.72,"end":117.14},{"text":" and drank his coffee.","start":117.14,"end":119.36},{"text":" These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half","start":119.36,"end":124.82},{"text":" an hour.","start":124.82,"end":126.76},{"text":" Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and","start":126.76,"end":132.16},{"text":" I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.","start":132.16,"end":135.32},{"text":" So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully","start":135.32,"end":140.18},{"text":" send them for me to read.

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory, and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses, and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy. And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It's not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.","segments":[{"text":" Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become","start":0.0,"end":9.72},{"text":" a Super Learner.","start":9.72,"end":11.200000000000001},{"text":" Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to","start":11.200000000000001,"end":15.36},{"text":" super learning.","start":15.36,"end":16.68},{"text":" Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.","start":16.68,"end":22.48},{"text":" Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the","start":22.48,"end":27.94},{"text":" vast potential of your mind.","start":27.94,"end":29.86},{"text":" Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.","start":29.86,"end":35.5},{"text":" It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking","start":35.5,"end":41.54},{"text":" for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.","start":41.54,"end":46.22},{"text":" It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making","start":46.22,"end":52.68000000000001},{"text":" it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.","start":52.68000000000001,"end":56.74},{"text":" Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking","start":56.74,"end":62.2},{"text":" your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.","start":62.2,"end":65.26},{"text":" Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.","start":65.26,"end":69.4},{"text":" But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course","start":69.4,"end":74.5},{"text":" originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.","start":74.5,"end":80.96000000000001},{"text":" So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture","start":80.96000000000001,"end":86.52000000000001},{"text":" capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who","start":86.52,"end":91.97999999999999},{"text":" was working in one of the startups there in the VC.","start":91.97999999999999,"end":96.06},{"text":" I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.","start":96.06,"end":101.97999999999999},{"text":" When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or","start":101.97999999999999,"end":107.52},{"text":" two with half a page of comments.","start":107.52,"end":111.72},{"text":" Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there","start":111.72,"end":117.14},{"text":" and drank his coffee.","start":117.14,"end":119.36},{"text":" These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half","start":119.36,"end":124.82},{"text":" an hour.","start":124.82,"end":126.76},{"text":" Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and","start":126.76,"end":132.16},{"text":" I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.","start":132.16,"end":135.32},{"text":" So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully","start":135.32,"end":140.18},{"text":" send them for me to read.

Use `--language` to specify the language\nDetected language: English\n[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become\n[00:09.720 --> 00:11.200]  a Super Learner.\n[00:11.200 --> 00:15.360]  Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to\n[00:15.360 --> 00:16.680]  super learning.\n[00:16.680 --> 00:22.480]  Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.\n[00:22.480 --> 00:27.940]  Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the\n[00:27.940 --> 00:29.860]  vast potential of your mind.\n[00:29.860 --> 00:35.500]  Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.\n[00:35.500 --> 00:41.540]  It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking\n[00:41.540 --> 00:46.220]  for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.\n[00:46.220 --> 00:52.680]  It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making\n[00:52.680 --> 00:56.740]  it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.\n[00:56.740 --> 01:02.200]  Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking\n[01:02.200 --> 01:05.260]  your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.\n[01:05.260 --> 01:09.400]  Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.\n[01:09.400 --> 01:14.500]  But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course\n[01:14.500 --> 01:20.960]  originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.\n[01:20.960 --> 01:26.520]  So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture\n[01:26.520 --> 01:31.980]  capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who\n[01:31.980 --> 01:36.060]  was working in one of the startups there in the VC.\n[01:36.060 --> 01:41.980]  I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.\n[01:41.980 --> 01:47.520]  When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or\n[01:47.520 --> 01:51.720]  two with half a page of comments.\n[01:51.720 --> 01:57.140]  Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there\n[01:57.140 --> 01:59.360]  and drank his coffee.\n[01:59.360 --> 02:04.820]  These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half\n[02:04.820 --> 02:06.760]  an hour.\n[02:06.760 --> 02:12.160]  Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and\n[02:12.160 --> 02:15.320]  I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.\n[02:15.320 --> 02:20.180]  So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully\n[02:20.180 --> 02:26.800]  send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when\n[02:26.800 --> 02:32.780]  I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension\n[02:32.780 --> 02:38.940]  of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it\n[02:38.940 --> 02:44.700]  before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he\n[02:44.700 --> 02:51.060]  was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was\n[02:51.060 --> 02:57.420]  sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity\n[02:57.420 --> 03:02.020]  when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for\n[03:02.020 --> 03:08.260]  something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists\n[03:08.260 --> 03:14.440]  here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques.\n[03:14.440 --> 03:20.680]  Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded.\n[03:20.680 --> 03:28.080]  I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading.\n[03:28.080 --> 03:34.300]  When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about\n[03:34.300 --> 03:36.700]  20% comprehension.\n[03:36.700 --> 03:46.840]  Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension.\n[03:46.840 --> 03:52.520]  Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and\n[03:52.520 --> 03:57.300]  fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions.\n[03:57.300 --> 04:02.680]  They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say\n[04:02.680 --> 04:10.360]  this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year\n[04:10.360 --> 04:16.640]  MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman\n[04:16.640 --> 04:23.080]  workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work,\n[04:23.080 --> 04:28.640]  reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15\n[04:28.640 --> 04:32.600]  minutes to read the exact same content.\n[04:32.600 --> 04:36.760]  There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd\n[04:36.760 --> 04:39.840]  really appreciate if you would actually read the article.\n[04:39.840 --> 04:43.020]  And I'd say, yeah, I read the article.\n[04:43.020 --> 04:49.140]  In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for.\n[04:49.140 --> 04:54.560]  Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions.\n[04:54.560 --> 04:58.120]  The biggest one is, can anyone do this?\n[04:58.120 --> 05:00.300]  And the answer is yes.\n[05:00.300 --> 05:04.720]  You can do this, but only with the proper instruction.\n[05:04.720 --> 05:09.820]  And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev.\n[05:09.820 --> 05:15.420]  Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private\n[05:15.420 --> 05:17.960]  coaching lessons via Skype.\n[05:17.960 --> 05:23.280]  But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise\n[05:23.280 --> 05:27.680]  her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach\n[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  everyone.\n[05:28.680 --> 05:34.560]  Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be\n[05:34.560 --> 05:40.460]  a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills.\n[05:40.460 --> 05:45.100]  So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research\n[05:45.100 --> 05:49.460]  that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it.\n[05:49.460 --> 05:54.680]  I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses,\n[05:54.680 --> 05:58.860]  and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more.\n[05:58.860 --> 06:03.780]  Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen\n[06:03.780 --> 06:04.780]  next.\n[06:04.780 --> 06:10.100]  Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students.\n[06:10.100 --> 06:13.080]  We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts.\n[06:13.080 --> 06:15.680]  We'd published a best-selling book.\n[06:15.680 --> 06:20.980]  We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.\n[06:20.980 --> 06:25.400]  And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0.\n[06:25.400 --> 06:29.440]  Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot.\n[06:29.440 --> 06:33.680]  We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where\n[06:33.680 --> 06:35.320]  students struggle.\n[06:35.320 --> 06:38.620]  We know which topics need a little more clarification.\n[06:38.620 --> 06:44.500]  We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations.\n[06:44.500 --> 06:49.920]  All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world\n[06:49.920 --> 06:55.140]  testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading\n[06:55.140 --> 06:58.380]  program on the face of the planet.\n[06:58.380 --> 07:03.260]  Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process,\n[07:03.260 --> 07:05.540]  starting with hacking your memory.\n[07:05.540 --> 07:10.320]  We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading\n[07:10.320 --> 07:15.980]  speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training.\n[07:15.980 --> 07:18.240]  It's not going to be easy.\n[07:18.240 --> 07:22.800]  Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading\n[07:22.800 --> 07:24.560]  programs out there.\n[07:24.560 --> 07:27.900]  It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn.\n[07:27.900 --> 07:33.040]  This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information\n[07:33.040 --> 07:35.020]  first and foremost.\n[07:35.020 --> 07:39.540]  What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going\n[07:39.540 --> 07:41.460]  to happen overnight.\n[07:41.460 --> 07:46.880]  But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you\n[07:46.880 --> 07:48.780]  will succeed.\n[07:48.780 --> 07:52.980]  If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all\n[07:52.980 --> 07:57.940]  of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn.\n[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping\n[08:02.460 --> 08:05.340]  to do the homework of that week at each stage.\n[08:05.340 --> 08:10.880]  And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.\n","status":"transcribing","task_id":"a2ecaa5d-b266-492e-8932-d98dfdc0512b"}]

Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when\n[02:26.800 --> 02:32.780]  I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension\n[02:32.780 --> 02:38.940]  of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it\n[02:38.940 --> 02:44.700]  before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he\n[02:44.700 --> 02:51.060]  was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was\n[02:51.060 --> 02:57.420]  sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity\n[02:57.420 --> 03:02.020]  when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for\n[03:02.020 --> 03:08.260]  something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists\n[03:08.260 --> 03:14.440]  here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques.\n[03:14.440 --> 03:20.680]  Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded.\n[03:20.680 --> 03:28.080]  I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading.\n[03:28.080 --> 03:34.300]  When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about\n[03:34.300 --> 03:36.700]  20% comprehension.\n[03:36.700 --> 03:46.840]  Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension.\n[03:46.840 --> 03:52.520]  Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and\n[03:52.520 --> 03:57.300]  fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions.\n[03:57.300 --> 04:02.680]  They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say\n[04:02.680 --> 04:10.360]  this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year\n[04:10.360 --> 04:16.640]  MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman\n[04:16.640 --> 04:23.080]  workload assigned by my professors.

So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC.

These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read.

It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses, and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy. And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It's not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.","segments":[{"text":" Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become","start":0.0,"end":9.72},{"text":" a Super Learner.","start":9.72,"end":11.200000000000001},{"text":" Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to","start":11.200000000000001,"end":15.36},{"text":" super learning.","start":15.36,"end":16.68},{"text":" Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.","start":16.68,"end":22.48},{"text":" Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the","start":22.48,"end":27.94},{"text":" vast potential of your mind.","start":27.94,"end":29.86},{"text":" Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.","start":29.86,"end":35.5},{"text":" It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking","start":35.5,"end":41.54},{"text":" for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.","start":41.54,"end":46.22},{"text":" It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making","start":46.22,"end":52.68000000000001},{"text":" it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.","start":52.68000000000001,"end":56.74},{"text":" Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking","start":56.74,"end":62.2},{"text":" your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.","start":62.2,"end":65.26},{"text":" Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.","start":65.26,"end":69.4},{"text":" But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course","start":69.4,"end":74.5},{"text":" originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.","start":74.5,"end":80.96000000000001},{"text":" So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture","start":80.96000000000001,"end":86.52000000000001},{"text":" capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who","start":86.52,"end":91.97999999999999},{"text":" was working in one of the startups there in the VC.","start":91.97999999999999,"end":96.06},{"text":" I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.","start":96.06,"end":101.97999999999999},{"text":" When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or","start":101.97999999999999,"end":107.52},{"text":" two with half a page of comments.","start":107.52,"end":111.72},{"text":" Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there","start":111.72,"end":117.14},{"text":" and drank his coffee.","start":117.14,"end":119.36},{"text":" These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half","start":119.36,"end":124.82},{"text":" an hour.","start":124.82,"end":126.76},{"text":" Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and","start":126.76,"end":132.16},{"text":" I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.","start":132.16,"end":135.32},{"text":" So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully","start":135.32,"end":140.18},{"text":" send them for me to read.

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory, and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses, and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.

Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when\n[02:26.800 --> 02:32.780]  I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension\n[02:32.780 --> 02:38.940]  of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it\n[02:38.940 --> 02:44.700]  before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he\n[02:44.700 --> 02:51.060]  was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was\n[02:51.060 --> 02:57.420]  sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity\n[02:57.420 --> 03:02.020]  when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for\n[03:02.020 --> 03:08.260]  something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists\n[03:08.260 --> 03:14.440]  here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques.\n[03:14.440 --> 03:20.680]  Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded.\n[03:20.680 --> 03:28.080]  I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading.\n[03:28.080 --> 03:34.300]  When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about\n[03:34.300 --> 03:36.700]  20% comprehension.\n[03:36.700 --> 03:46.840]  Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension.\n[03:46.840 --> 03:52.520]  Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and\n[03:52.520 --> 03:57.300]  fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions.\n[03:57.300 --> 04:02.680]  They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say\n[04:02.680 --> 04:10.360]  this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year\n[04:10.360 --> 04:16.640]  MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman\n[04:16.640 --> 04:23.080]  workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work,\n[04:23.080 --> 04:28.640]  reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15\n[04:28.640 --> 04:32.600]  minutes to read the exact same content.\n[04:32.600 --> 04:36.760]  There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd\n[04:36.760 --> 04:39.840]  really appreciate if you would actually read the article.\n[04:39.840 --> 04:43.020]  And I'd say, yeah, I read the article.\n[04:43.020 --> 04:49.140]  In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for.\n[04:49.140 --> 04:54.560]  Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions.\n[04:54.560 --> 04:58.120]  The biggest one is, can anyone do this?\n[04:58.120 --> 05:00.300]  And the answer is yes.\n[05:00.300 --> 05:04.720]  You can do this, but only with the proper instruction.\n[05:04.720 --> 05:09.820]  And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev.\n[05:09.820 --> 05:15.420]  Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private\n[05:15.420 --> 05:17.960]  coaching lessons via Skype.\n[05:17.960 --> 05:23.280]  But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise\n[05:23.280 --> 05:27.680]  her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach\n[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  everyone.\n[05:28.680 --> 05:34.560]  Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be\n[05:34.560 --> 05:40.460]  a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills.\n[05:40.460 --> 05:45.100]  So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research\n[05:45.100 --> 05:49.460]  that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it.\n[05:49.460 --> 05:54.680]  I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses,\n[05:54.680 --> 05:58.860]  and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more.\n[05:58.860 --> 06:03.780]  Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen\n[06:03.780 --> 06:04.780]  next.\n[06:04.780 --> 06:10.100]  Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students.\n[06:10.100 --> 06:13.080]  We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts.\n[06:13.080 --> 06:15.680]  We'd published a best-selling book.\n[06:15.680 --> 06:20.980]  We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.\n[06:20.980 --> 06:25.400]  And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0.\n[06:25.400 --> 06:29.440]  Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot.\n[06:29.440 --> 06:33.680]  We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where\n[06:33.680 --> 06:35.320]  students struggle.\n[06:35.320 --> 06:38.620]  We know which topics need a little more clarification.\n[06:38.620 --> 06:44.500]  We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations.\n[06:44.500 --> 06:49.920]  All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world\n[06:49.920 --> 06:55.140]  testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading\n[06:55.140 --> 06:58.380]  program on the face of the planet.\n[06:58.380 --> 07:03.260]  Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process,\n[07:03.260 --> 07:05.540]  starting with hacking your memory.\n[07:05.540 --> 07:10.320]  We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading\n[07:10.320 --> 07:15.980]  speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training.\n[07:15.980 --> 07:18.240]  It's not going to be easy.\n[07:18.240 --> 07:22.800]  Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading\n[07:22.800 --> 07:24.560]  programs out there.\n[07:24.560 --> 07:27.900]  It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn.\n[07:27.900 --> 07:33.040]  This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information\n[07:33.040 --> 07:35.020]  first and foremost.\n[07:35.020 --> 07:39.540]  What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going\n[07:39.540 --> 07:41.460]  to happen overnight.\n[07:41.460 --> 07:46.880]  But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you\n[07:46.880 --> 07:48.780]  will succeed.\n[07:48.780 --> 07:52.980]  If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all\n[07:52.980 --> 07:57.940]  of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn.\n[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping\n[08:02.460 --> 08:05.340]  to do the homework of that week at each stage.\n[08:05.340 --> 08:10.880]  And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.\n","status":"transcribing","task_id":"66536dd6-2094-4c59-acec-f5cb471f1fdf"}]

You'll find the exact information we're looking for.\n[04:49.140 --> 04:54.560]  Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions.\n[04:54.560 --> 04:58.120]  The biggest one is, can anyone do this?\n[04:58.120 --> 05:00.300]  And the answer is yes.\n[05:00.300 --> 05:04.720]  You can do this, but only with the proper instruction.\n[05:04.720 --> 05:09.820]  And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev.\n[05:09.820 --> 05:15.420]  Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private\n[05:15.420 --> 05:17.960]  coaching lessons via Skype.\n[05:17.960 --> 05:23.280]  But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise\n[05:23.280 --> 05:27.680]  her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach\n[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  everyone.\n[05:28.680 --> 05:34.560]  Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be\n[05:34.560 --> 05:40.460]  a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills.\n[05:40.460 --> 05:45.100]  So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research\n[05:45.100 --> 05:49.460]  that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it.\n[05:49.460 --> 05:54.680]  I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses,\n[05:54.680 --> 05:58.860]  and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more.\n[05:58.860 --> 06:03.780]  Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen\n[06:03.780 --> 06:04.780]  next.\n[06:04.780 --> 06:10.100]  Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students.\n[06:10.100 --> 06:13.080]  We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts.\n[06:13.080 --> 06:15.680]  We'd published a best-selling book.\n[06:15.680 --> 06:20.980]  We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy.\n[06:20.980 --> 06:25.400]  And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0.\n[06:25.400 --> 06:29.440]  Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot.\n[06:29.440 --> 06:33.680]  We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where\n[06:33.680 --> 06:35.320]  students struggle.\n[06:35.320 --> 06:38.620]  We know which topics need a little more clarification.\n[06:38.620 --> 06:44.500]  We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations.\n[06:44.500 --> 06:49.920]  All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world\n[06:49.920 --> 06:55.140]  testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading\n[06:55.140 --> 06:58.380]  program on the face of the planet.\n[06:58.380 --> 07:03.260]  Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process,\n[07:03.260 --> 07:05.540]  starting with hacking your memory.\n[07:05.540 --> 07:10.320]  We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading\n[07:10.320 --> 07:15.980]  speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training.\n[07:15.980 --> 07:18.240]  It's not going to be easy.\n[07:18.240 --> 07:22.800]  Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading\n[07:22.800 --> 07:24.560]  programs out there.\n[07:24.560 --> 07:27.900]  It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn.\n[07:27.900 --> 07:33.040]  This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information\n[07:33.040 --> 07:35.020]  first and foremost.\n[07:35.020 --> 07:39.540]  What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going\n[07:39.540 --> 07:41.460]  to happen overnight.\n[07:41.460 --> 07:46.880]  But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you\n[07:46.880 --> 07:48.780]  will succeed.\n[07:48.780 --> 07:52.980]  If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all\n[07:52.980 --> 07:57.940]  of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn.\n[07:57.940 --> 08:02.460]  But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping\n[08:02.460 --> 08:05.340]  to do the homework of that week at each stage.\n[08:05.340 --> 08:10.880]  And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.\n","status":"transcribing","task_id":"66536dd6-2094-4c59-acec-f5cb471f1fdf"}]

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory, and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content.

The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone.

Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind. Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory, and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception. So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully send them for me to read. Lev told me that actually he did read the articles, and when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, oh, you read it before I sent it to you. My mistake. He told me that no, actually the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. I'd tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I'd tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80-90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, Anna offered private coaching sessions. They weren't cheap, and the whole process took about 6 weeks, but, and I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one-year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near superhuman workload assigned by my professors. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10-15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, you know, we'd really appreciate if you would actually read the article. And I'd say, yeah, I read the article. In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C. You'll find the exact information we're looking for. Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes. You can do this, but only with the proper instruction. And in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now for this reason, at first I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses, and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could have never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts. We'd published a best-selling book. We even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy. And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0. Over the years since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content like worksheets and quizzes and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading program on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process, starting with hacking your memory. We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It's not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programs out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this, you're going to have to work for this and it's not going to happen overnight. But with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed. If you're eager and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one by one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in and start setting up to succeed in this course.","segments":[{"text":" Hi, my name is Jonathan Levy and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, Become","start":0.0,"end":9.72},{"text":" a Super Learner.","start":9.72,"end":11.200000000000001},{"text":" Perhaps you're just joining us and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to","start":11.200000000000001,"end":15.36},{"text":" super learning.","start":15.36,"end":16.68},{"text":" Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course.","start":16.68,"end":22.48},{"text":" Either way, you're here because you want to learn faster, remember more, and unlock the","start":22.48,"end":27.94},{"text":" vast potential of your mind.","start":27.94,"end":29.86},{"text":" Well, you're in great hands because this course will help you do all of that.","start":29.86,"end":35.5},{"text":" It requires no prior knowledge and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking","start":35.5,"end":41.54},{"text":" for a review or even people seeking more advanced techniques.","start":41.54,"end":46.22},{"text":" It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making","start":46.22,"end":52.68000000000001},{"text":" it our most effective and comprehensive course to date.","start":52.68000000000001,"end":56.74},{"text":" Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking","start":56.74,"end":62.2},{"text":" your memory, and upgrading your reading speed.","start":62.2,"end":65.26},{"text":" Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too.","start":65.26,"end":69.4},{"text":" But before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course","start":69.4,"end":74.5},{"text":" originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.","start":74.5,"end":80.96000000000001},{"text":" So about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture","start":80.96000000000001,"end":86.52000000000001},{"text":" capital firm with some very smart people, and I came to know someone named Lev, who","start":86.52,"end":91.97999999999999},{"text":" was working in one of the startups there in the VC.","start":91.97999999999999,"end":96.06},{"text":" I realized that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests.","start":96.06,"end":101.97999999999999},{"text":" When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or","start":101.97999999999999,"end":107.52},{"text":" two with half a page of comments.","start":107.52,"end":111.72},{"text":" Lev also had a habit of sending me 5 to 10 news articles every morning as he sat there","start":111.72,"end":117.14},{"text":" and drank his coffee.","start":117.14,"end":119.36},{"text":" These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half","start":119.36,"end":124.82},{"text":" an hour.","start":124.82,"end":126.76},{"text":" Now eventually, I started to wonder what was up, and so I went into Lev's office and","start":126.76,"end":132.16},{"text":" I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page.","start":132.16,"end":135.32},{"text":" So I said, Lev, if you're not going to actually read the articles, you can't rightfully","start":135.32,"end":140.18},{"text":" send them for me to read.
